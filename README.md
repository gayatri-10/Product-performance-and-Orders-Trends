# Product-performance-and-Orders-Trends
In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using PostgreSQL and Power BI to gain insights from a set of business-related tables. 
The database contains tables for Customers, Products, Orders, and Employees, which allowed me to analyze various aspects of the business operations, including sales performance, product inventory, customer behavior, and employee data.

Key Activities:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Utilized SQL queries to explore and aggregate data from the Customers, Products, Orders, and Employees tables.
Analyzed customer demographics, order histories, and buying patterns.
Assessed product stock levels, pricing trends, and sales volumes.
Examined employee roles, salaries, and tenure to understand workforce distribution.
Data Visualizations in Power BI:

Created interactive dashboards to visualize key business metrics, such as:
Total sales by product category and customer region.
Order trends over time, identifying seasonal patterns or spikes in demand.
Product inventory levels and stock-outs.
Employee distribution by department, salary ranges, and tenure.
Leveraged Power BIâ€™s drill-down and filtering capabilities for deeper insights into the data.
Insights and Actionable Takeaways:

Identified high-performing products and customers based on sales volume and total revenue.
Highlighted inventory management gaps, suggesting areas to optimize stock levels.
Analyzed employee data to provide insights on salary distribution, hiring trends, and team structures.
This work aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of business operations, enabling better decision-making in areas like marketing, inventory management, and workforce planning.
